<h1>WEDDING!</h1>
<p>We're celebrating getting married on Saturday 29th October 2016 and we'd like YOU to come!
<p>The purpose of this website was meant to be twofold: <li>I would fulfill my dreams of learning how to make <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.benedikt/home.html" target="_blank">old school Oxford comp sci brutalist websites</a> from scratch</li> <li>you would have easy access to all information you might require for smooth wedding attendance.</li>
<p>Unfortunately, the first aim was never realised and my <a href="https://github.com/lollardy">github</a> will languish emptily forever (sorry Paul). But we hope that we have achieved the second, and if not you can always: look things up online; call us; email, etc.
